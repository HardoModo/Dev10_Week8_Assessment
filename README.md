# Dev10 Week8 Assessment

This assessment was designed to allow you to demonstrate multiple skill sets: API consumption, Python programming, cleaning and transforming data with Pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, using Github and working in teams.

## Authors

Shervorn Mathews, Janeel Abrahams, Jin Hee Lee

## Data Sources

This project was done using  [the Census API](https://api.census.gov/data.html), specifically the [Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs for 2019](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html).

## ETL Steps

Using the [ABS APIs for 2019](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html). Each step is more thoroughly noted in the notebook as Markdown

1. Consume the API
2. Clean the data
3. Merge the data
4. Transform the data

## Visualizations

The visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn. There are instruction in the visualization section on how to install or check your version of these packages if needed.

## ETL Report

Write a report that details your steps in cleaning your data. This report may be given to another group to replicate your research and verify your claims.

- If the order matters in how the steps are taken, make sure to use numbered steps.

- If the order matters in how tables are combined, be explicit in stating that order.

- If you used a Jupyter Notebook to do the ETL process, you can submit the Jupyter Notebook for this part. Use text blocks to explain the processes rather than letting the code explain itself.

## Write a Project Report

1. Write a formal technical report that explains your research that includes:

    - Identifying and citing your data sources
Listing your initial questions

    - Explaining the process to answer those questions

    - Answering those questions or indicating if more research may be needed. If more research is needed, suggest what research may need to be done.

2. Format the report professionally. Suppose you are presenting this to your future employers. What would you want them to see?
Run spelling and grammar checks

## Check the Project Into GitHub

1. Create a GitHub repository for your group's presentation materials.

2. Include all code for processing the API data.

    - This code should all be stored in a Jupyter Notebook.

    - All visualizations need to be created in Python.

3. Be sure to show the use of pandas for cleaning, merging, and transforming data.

4. Include the report in your GitHub repository.

5. Create a detailed README.md that introduces your repository, sets the expectations on where to find things, and mentions each group member's contributions.

6. Submit a [link](https://github.com/HardoModo/Dev10_Week8_Assessment) to your GitHub repository.

## Present Your Exploration

You will be sharing your findings to the class in a 10-15 minute presentation and will receive feedback from your instructors.
